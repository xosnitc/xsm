This machine is a pure string machine. Make necessary changes to the maximum size of string if needed.

There are three steps involved before running this machine:

1. Compiling:
      a. In case of SPSIL code use the SPSIL compiler.
	  Syntax: ./spsil < filename
      b. In case of APSIL code use the APSIL compiler.
	  Syntax: ./apsil < filename
      The compiled code will contained labels. In order to remove labels use aac executable. An esim file has to be
      given as input to this executable.
	  Syntax: ./aac < esim filename.
      The labels replaced file will have name labels_replaced.esim.

2. Loading the file to disk:
      a. Use the fileSystem executable. Initial formatting is necessary if disk is going to be used for the first time.
      b. Use the interface to load the executable.

3. Running the machine:
      a. Use the esim executable. Use -id if you want to disable timer interrupt.
      Note: Make sure that OS startup code is present. Since string checking is not available in SPSIL, it is impossible to search
      for a file on the disk. For this use the init program. The location for this on the disk is fixed as the starting four data blocks on
      disk.The first block is the basic block and the remaining three will be the data blocks.


There are TODO's in the machine and filesystem folder. Read them. They contain some problems we encountered but didn't have time to fix.
Also add a download link for the machine code on the website. Don't upload the interrupts code which we wrote onto github since the repo is public.
